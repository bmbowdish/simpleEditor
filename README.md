### What is simpleEditor?

Simple editor is a text editor that is extremely simple. 
You can type normal files like any normal editor, but you can also test your python code in the editor.
Below is the original README by Suresh Subedi for his project text-editor-in-tkinter which this project is forked from. 

> **How to make a simple but robust text editor in tkinter**

> Hello everyone!

> I love writing text editors. I have written many in many languages: Java, Javascript and Html, Python, Qt. Today I’ll share with you an example in python 3 and tkinter.

> Our text editor will be able to open and save files (obviously). 
> What our text editor does that other examples often don’t is it will ask us to save our changes (if there are any) before creating new file, opening another file or closing the program. 
> We will be writing it in python 3 and tkinter.You can extend it yourself to extend its features.
